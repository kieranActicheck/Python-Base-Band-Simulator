### FILE: httpSimulatorDev.py 
Bill's code unmodified.

### FILE: httpSimulatorDevKE.py 
My altered version of Bill's code.

The Python script is designed to simulate HTTP communication with a server endpoint. For testing purposes, I have been using my modified version of the Python script with this https://github.com/kieranActicheck/ActicheckDemo BandPayloadProcessor web API server.

Here are some differences in the altered version of the code:

### Additional Imports:
The altered code adds imports for requests and logging to enable HTTP requests and logging functionalities. This allows the code to send data to an external API. 

### Logging setup:
Sets up logging using the logging module to log information and errors.

### Sending Data to an API:
Adds functionality to send data to an API endpoint using the requests library.

### Error Handling:
Adds specific error handling for the API request using requests.exceptions.RequestException.

### Code Structure and Comments:
Cleans up some of the commented-out code and adds structured logging for better readability and debugging.
